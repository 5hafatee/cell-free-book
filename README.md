Foundations of User-Centric Cell-Free Massive MIMO
==================

This repository contains the code package related to the textbook:

Özlem Tuğfe Demir, Emil Björnson, and Luca Sanguinetti (2021) “[Foundations of User-Centric Cell-Free Massive MIMO](https://www.nowpublishers.com/article/Details/SIG-109)”, Foundations and Trends in Signal Processing: Vol. 14, No. 3-4, pp. 162-472. DOI: 10.1561/2000000109.

The package contains a simulation environment, based on Matlab, that can be used to reproduce all the simulation results in the monograph. We hope that the code will support you in the learning of the Cell-free Massive MIMO topic and also serve as a baseline for further research endeavors. We encourage you to also perform reproducible research! *We encourage you to also perform reproducible research!*
